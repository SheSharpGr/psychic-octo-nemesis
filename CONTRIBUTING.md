## Pull Requests

To ensure smooth collaboration in this project we will use pull requests in order to contribute to the code base.

Either part of the team or any only other person should create a new branch, based off `master` with their changes. In case of team members it would be better for a repository branch instead of a personal fork brach.


## Issues

We will use [our issues](https://github.com/SheSharpGr/psychic-octo-nemesis/issues) for the project management and for our bug tracking. Labels, assignments and milestones will also be used.


## Git Commit Messages

Generally we do not really care about the commit messages. Some guidelines, however, would be:
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* No full stop at the end ("Add feature XYZ" not "Added feature XYZ.")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
